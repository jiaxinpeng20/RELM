# RELM
RELM is implemented based on Changchang Wu's PBA. The LM algorithm with Nielsen's method is replaced with RELM. We only upload the source files related to our RELM   algorithm. The experimental results can be reproduced by replacing SparseBundleCPU.cpp and SparseBundleCPU.h in PBA with the uploaded source files.
